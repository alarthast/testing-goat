This is a repo that follows along the
[Obey the Testing Goat Book](https://www.obeythetestinggoat.com/pages/book.html).

It is generated from the opensafely-core template since I'd like to benefit from
and learn about the tooling used at the Bennett Institute (e.g. `just`)
at the same time as following the book.
